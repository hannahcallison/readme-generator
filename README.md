## Introduction

For this project, we made a ReadMe Generator using Node and Inquirer. By opening the integrated terminalk, users can create a ReadMe by filling out the command line prompts. The create file function will produce their new doc with all of their information populated on the ReadMe. 

## User Interaction Criteria

Users will need to download Node and Inquirer for the program to work.
